3. cd â€” Use the "cd" command to go to a directory. For example, if you are in the home folder, and you want to go to the downloads folder, then you can type in â€œcd Downloadsâ€. Remember, this command is case sensitive, and you have to type in the name of the folder exactly as it is. But there is a problem with these commands. Imagine you have a folder named â€œRaspberry Piâ€. In this case, when you type in â€œcd Raspberry Piâ€, the shell will take the second argument of the command as a different one, so you will get an error saying that the directory does not exist. Here, you can use a backward slash. That is, you can use â€œcd Raspberry\ Piâ€ in this case. Spaces are denoted like this: If you just type â€œcdâ€ and press enter, it takes you to the home directory. To go back from a folder to the folder before that, you can type â€œcd ..â€ . The two dots represent back.
