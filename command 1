 pwd â€” When you first open the terminal, you are in the home directory of your user. To know which directory you are in, you can use the â€œpwdâ€ command. It gives us the absolute path, which means the path that starts from the root. The root is the base of the Linux file system. It is denoted by a forward slash( / ). The user directory is usually something like "/home/username".
